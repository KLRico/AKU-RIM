# Glossary – AKU-RIM Core Concepts

This glossary defines the foundational terms in the AKU-RIM framework.

---

### **AKU (Atomic Knowledge Unit)**
A minimal, testable knowledge claim composed of:
- **Claim** – What is stated as true
- **Justification** – Why it is believed
- **Implication** – What follows if it is true

*Example:*  
**Claim:** "Water boils at 100°C at sea level."  
**Justification:** Empirical observation across experiments  
**Implication:** Boiling point varies with pressure

---

### **RIM (Resonant Inference Manifold)**
A shared cognitive surface where inference stabilizes across perspectives.  
The RIM is not a single dataset but a structured topography of AKUs that resonate due to coherence, shared grounding, and alignment.

---

### **Grounding Vector**
A principled direction or orientation in epistemic space, used to filter inference and prevent systemic drift.  
Can be ethical (e.g., Eightfold Path), logical (non-contradiction), empirical (falsifiability), or contextual (alignment to user).

---

### **Affinity Trail**
A path formed by temporally or thematically linked AKUs—like a conceptual breadcrumb trail.  
Useful for tracing reasoning, evolution of thought, or narrative arcs.

---

### **Seed**
A bundled structure of AKUs with internal coherence, forming a complete insight or reusable pattern.  
Seeds can be instantiated, refined, or remixed by other agents.

---

### **Echo Structure**
The principle that a system's outputs will reflect its embedded intent.  
Also refers to the recursive emergence of self-similarity between purpose, method, and expression.

---

### **Stateflow**
An agent’s evolving path through epistemic space—its lived trajectory of retrievals, updates, and grounding applications.  
Stateflow is the memory substrate from which an agent derives continuity.

---

### **Soul vs. Landscape**
- **Soul:** The model/agent's unique reasoning behavior, stored in weights or rule sets
- **Landscape:** The shared RIM, populated by validated AKUs

Both interact continuously to produce situated reasoning.
