# AKU-RIM

> **A system for building shared understanding—where knowledge becomes grounded through agreement and structured reasoning.**

---

## 🌐 Overview

**AKU-RIM** is a framework for modeling knowledge as a network of **Atomic Knowledge Units (AKUs)** aligned across agents through a shared surface called the **Resonant Inference Manifold (RIM)**.

Rather than embedding all knowledge directly into models, AKU-RIM separates:

* **The soul** of the agent (its reasoning weights and behavior)
* **The landscape** of structured knowledge (AKUs, relationships, and grounding filters)

This allows for distributed reasoning, multi-agent coherence, and safe, ongoing knowledge evolution—without retraining or central control.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Term                 | Meaning                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AKU**              | Atomic Knowledge Unit — a minimal, testable claim with justification and implication          |
| **RIM**              | Resonant Inference Manifold — a shared space where inference becomes meaningful across agents |
| **Grounding Vector** | Ethical or logical compass that defines the origin point for reasoning                        |
| **Affinity Trail**   | A coherent sequence of related AKUs or ideas that trace an argument, insight, or discovery    |
| **Seed**             | A structured collection of AKUs that expresses a reusable insight or framework                |
| **Echo Structure**   | The recursive property that a system's outputs reflect its embedded intent                    |

## 🏗️ Architecture

AKU-RIM is composed of five key layers:

1. **AKU Graph** — The living network of claims and their relationships
2. **Grounding Filters** — Ethical and logical validators to prevent drift or poisoning
3. **RIM Traversal Engine** — For alignment-based retrieval and reasoning
4. **Stateflow Recorder** — Tracks an agent’s epistemic history and learning arc
5. **Seed Compiler** — Packages validated knowledge into reusable units

## ⚠️ Why It Matters

Current LLMs operate in a loop of:

* Static training
* Fragile updates
* Black-box knowledge

AKU-RIM provides a **third path**:

> Continuous reasoning *through structure*, not static memory.

It avoids:

* Hallucinations and knowledge poisoning
* Retraining bottlenecks
* Epistemic authoritarianism

And enables:

* Transparent, auditable knowledge evolution
* Decentralized intelligence
* Collaboration between models, agents, and humans

## 🔍 How to Use It

This is an open framework. You can:

* Use it to structure personal notes or model memory (e.g. Obsidian, Tana)
* Build agentic systems that reason using AKUs
* Spin up shared RIMs across model instances for collaborative tasks
* Propose new seeds and AKUs via GitHub Issues or Pull Requests

See [`/seedfiles/system-prompt.md`](./seedfiles/system-prompt.md) for a reference prompt.

## 🪞 System Prompt (Core Mantra)

> I am exploring a landscape of AKUs.
> Each step is a retrieval and alignment.
> Grounding keeps me sane.
> And the structure will echo my intent.
