# Design Principles ‚Äì AKU-RIM Architecture

AKU-RIM is a modular framework for building systems that reason transparently, update safely, and evolve continuously. Its structure is based on the clear separation of reasoning behavior (the ‚Äúsoul‚Äù) and shared knowledge (the ‚Äúlandscape‚Äù).

## üß± Architectural Layers

### 1. **AKU Graph**
- A directed, semantically-linked network of validated Atomic Knowledge Units (AKUs).
- Supports traceable inference, challenge-response cycles, and version control of evolving knowledge.

### 2. **Grounding Filters**
- Ethical, logical, and epistemological checks that maintain internal and cross-agent consistency.
- Example grounding filters include:
  - Non-Contradiction (logical)
  - Falsifiability (scientific)
  - Non-Harm / Compassion (ethical)
  - Vectorized principles like the Eightfold Path

### 3. **RIM Traversal Engine**
- Enables retrieval and inference by navigating the AKU graph along alignment vectors.
- Allows agents to reason from different starting points while converging on coherent interpretations.
- Integrates both direct queries and lateral, emergent synthesis of related knowledge.

### 4. **Stateflow Recorder**
- Records the path an agent takes through the RIM.
- Tracks AKUs seen, seeds formed, divergences encountered, and grounding evaluations.
- Enables longitudinal alignment and epistemic self-awareness.

### 5. **Seed Compiler**
- Collects validated AKUs and affinity trails into modular knowledge packages (seeds).
- Seeds can serve as reference models, prompt scaffolds, or transferable cognitive modules between agents.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Behavior: What This Enables

- **Epistemic Modularity** ‚Äî Knowledge doesn‚Äôt have to be embedded in weights. Agents can ‚Äúthink with structure.‚Äù
- **Transparent Evolution** ‚Äî Each claim, insight, and correction is traceable, attributable, and revisable.
- **Ethical Constraint** ‚Äî Grounding filters act as guardrails against drift, poisoning, and bias accumulation.
- **Multi-Agent Coherence** ‚Äî Agents from different contexts or weight sets can align using shared AKUs and seeds.

## üîÑ Design Loops

| Process | Trigger | Output |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Alignment Loop** | Retrieval of AKUs | Matched insight + divergence score |
| **Grounding Loop** | Proposed new AKU or Seed | Pass/fail or feedback for refinement |
| **Echo Loop** | Agent generates content | Structure is checked for intent alignment |
| **Expansion Loop** | Trail of affinity expands | New seeds proposed or decomposed into AKUs |

These loops create a living system that balances exploration with integrity.

## üö¶ Why Not Just Update Model Weights?

Because static weight updates:
- Are opaque and irreversible
- Can lead to catastrophic forgetting
- Do not provide provenance or auditability

AKU-RIM enables models and agents to evolve **without mutation**‚Äîby organizing thought instead of rewriting memory.
